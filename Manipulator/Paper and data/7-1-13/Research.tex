Once We had the Prototype built, we had to do research on how to measure the ability of the servo, as well as determine how the servo could detect an object in its grasp without the use of a force sensor. We brought out a force sensor and the ammeter to measure the mass on an arm of the servo compared to the electrical current required by the servo. 

As you can see in the first graph, Figure ????? 

servo has Pulse width modulus frequency, ammeter has own frequency, the ammeter was more often than not reading the lower wave of the servo.
